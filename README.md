my_webscraper
=============

Worked through a web scraping tutorial on [Newcoder.io](http://newcoder.io/scrape/) -- Thanks, Lynn!

The website example changed its div classes, so I had to wrestle with the code in order for the scraper to pick up the information. 

To use these files, make sure your all the proper files loaded.

This is how you run the script.

```language-python
(ScrapeProj) $ cd my_web_scraper/scraper_app
(ScrapeProj) $ scrapy crawl livingsocial
```
