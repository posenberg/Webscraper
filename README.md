Living Social Webscraper
=============

Worked through a web scraping tutorial on [Newcoder.io](http://newcoder.io/scrape/) -- Thanks, Lynn!

The website example changed its div classes, so I had to wrestle with the code in order for the scraper to pick up the information. 

To use these files, make sure you have all packages installed from requirements.txt installed (preferably onto a virtual environment).

**Hint** use: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the web scraper: 

```language-python
(ScrapeProj) $ cd my_web_scraper/scraper_app
(ScrapeProj) $ scrapy crawl livingsocial
```
