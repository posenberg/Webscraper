my_webscraper
=============

Worked through a web scraping tutorial on [Newcoder.io](http://newcoder.io/scrape/) -- Thanks, Lynn!

The website example changed its div classes, so I had to wrestle with the code in order for the scraper to pick up the information. 

To use these files, make sure you

This is how you run the script.
```language-python
(ScrapeProj) $ cd my_scraper/scraper_app
(ScrapeProj) $ scrapy crawl livingsocial
```
